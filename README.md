# MERN Stack Boilerplate

This is a boiler plate app for a MERN stack application. It's built using create-react-app and the MongoDB walkthrough tutorial.

It updates a MongoDB Atlas instance using CRUD operations.

Current dependencies include those in the c-r-a toolchain, bootstrap, react-router, express, dotenv, and cors.

To prepare the app for use, instantiate a MongoDB Atlas instance, clone the repo and run npm install in each of the server and client directories, rename config.env2 to config.env, and update it with the MongoDB username and password info.

For Dev purposes, you will likely need to add your IP to the Network Access tab within your instantiated Mongo database.
